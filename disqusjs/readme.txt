A lightweight solution for adding Disqus to your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

This plugin will remove any of the default WordPress comments features from your site, and replace this with Disqus.

Please note: Disqus comments will not be automatically imported into your WordPress dashboard. Instead, you can continue to moderate your comments via your Disqus moderation page. This plugin will add a quick link to your Disqus moderation page in the WordPress Admin Bar.

Reasons to use this plugin:

* Simplify your WordPress dashboard by removing the "Comments" admin menu.
* Easy setup: simply add the Disqus shortname in the settings and you're done.
* Comments are NOT imported to WordPress - save server resources and database size.
* Improved spam protection to keep junk out your site's database.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin.
2. Add your Disqus Shortname to `Settings > WPDisqusJs`.

== Screenshots ==
1. Admin Bar Shortcut
